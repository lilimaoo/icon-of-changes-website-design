                    <p>IN a time when global challenges call for bold leadership and innovative thinking, the Icons of Change Awards 2025 stands out as a unique and powerful celebration of individuals and organizations driving meaningful transformation.</p>
                    
                    <p>This year's ceremony at Southville International School and Colleges in Las PiÃ±as City, on April 27, 2025, goes beyond traditional award events by shining a spotlight on unsung heroes â changemakers whose impact has often gone unnoticed, yet whose work has created real, lasting progress in their communities and fields.</p>
                    
                    <p>Anchored on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and commemorating the United Nations International Year of Peace and Trust, the event is paired with the Metro Manila SDG Action Summit 2025, offering a multi-dimensional platform that merges recognition, advocacy and collaboration.</p>
                    
                    <p>"What makes this event truly distinct is its inclusive and values-driven approach to recognition. Awardees range from national leaders and social entrepreneurs to artists and civil servants â each selected for their commitment to sustainability, innovation, and social responsibility," awards chairman and convenor Justin Ho shared.</p>
                    
                    <p>Among the notable honorees this year are international actor Mon Confiado, actress and former Calatagan, Batangas Vice Mayor Andrea Del Rosario, Philippine Red Cross Secretary-General Gwen Pang, educator-entrepreneur Carl Balita, Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Undersecretary David Almirol, Anti-Red Tape Authority Undersecretary Gerald Divinagracia, Presidential Communications Office Undersecretary and Presidential Broadcast Staff-Radio Television MalacaÃ±ang Executive Director Franz Gerald Imperial alongside a diverse set of public and private sector changemakers such as Rizal Commercial Banking Corp.

                    <p>Adding to the uniqueness of the ceremony is a Sustainability Pledge Commitment Signing led by previous and present awardees, an exhibit booth by DICT showcasing e-government initiatives, and special performances by World Championship of Performing Arts artists, creating a holistic experience that celebrates both purpose and passion.</p>
                    
                    <p>The event also showcases its commitment to efficiency and inclusivity, with a diverse program lineup of over 20 influential speakers, including military officials, government undersecretaries, media figures, and nonprofit leaders âall delivering timely, impactful messages.</p>
                    
                    <p>For those unable to attend in person, pre-recorded speeches ensure their voices are still part of the celebration.</p>
                    
                    <p>Meanwhile, platforms like "Rise and Shine Pilipinas" of PTV4, Pulis News Network, ABS-CBN, One Radio, Newswatch Plus and Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission are recognized not only as awardees but also as partners in information and empowerment.</p>

                    <p>"As the world looks to 2030 and the full realization of the SDGs, the Icons of Change Awards 2025 offers more than just recognition; it offers a movement â one that amplifies the efforts of those creating change quietly and powerfully. It reminds us that true transformation doesn't always make headlines, but it makes a difference," Ho concluded.</p>

                    <p>ON April 27, 2025, I had the immense honor of being recognized as one of the Icons of Change awardees, receiving the Champion in Climate Advocacy and Sustainability Leadership award. This accolade serves not just as a personal milestone but as a celebration of the collective action and unwavering commitment of advocates, changemakers and visionaries who stand together in the fight against climate change.</p>
                    
                    <p>A video message shared on the Icons of Change Facebook page expressed my heartfelt gratitude and humility in accepting the "Icons of Change Awards 2025" for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13: Climate Action. To be acknowledged for my contributions in promoting climate awareness, shaping policies for sustainable business practices and mentoring the next generation is an unexpected honor that fills me with pride. This recognition amplifies the tireless efforts put forth by the many unsung heroes dedicated to advancing climate action and sustainability.</p>
                    
                    <p>In reflecting on my journey, I am reminded that the urgency to address climate change grows every day. The acknowledgment I received is a testament to the collaborative spirit among all those committed to fostering a more sustainable world. For over 10 years, I have engaged with mentors, partners and communities that have inspired me to bridge the worlds of business, academia and policymaking, ultimately contributing to a shared vision of climate resilience.</p>
                    
                    <p>I emphasized during the ceremony, "Over the years, our collective efforts have been driven by a vision: to create a world where climate action is not merely an aspiration but a shared commitment. Each one of us here, in our own capacity, has taken bold steps to tackle the pressing climate issues facing our communities and ecosystems."</p>
                    
                    <p>At the ceremony, I conveyed that this moment coincides with the United Nations' celebration of the International Year of Peace and Trust, highlighting the interconnectedness of climate action with social equity and environmental stewardship. True sustainability is rooted in community and trust. Our collective efforts forge paths toward creating a world where climate action is not just an aspiration but a commitment shared by all.</p>
                    
                    <p>I also said, "Our journeys as Icons of Change do not exist in isolation. We are all encouraged by the collective spirit of resilience and action demonstrated by the many unsung heroes across the globe who are driving initiatives that align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. These goals are not just targets to be met; they embody our aspirations for a more equitable, just and sustainable world."</p>
                    
                    <h3>Impactful changes</h3>
                    
                    <p>My work with initiatives like the Young Environmental Forum and my opinion pieces at The Manila Times have empowered thousands of young individuals to become advocates for sustainability, nurturing future leaders who will champion climate action within their communities. Our collective journey encourages us to celebrate the impactful changes that stem from grassroots movements and the collaborative initiatives aligning with the UN SDGs.</p>
                    
                    <p>Yet we must acknowledge the challenges that lie ahead. Climate change is an ongoing crisis that requires immediate and sustained action. I urge everyone here to carry the torch of advocacy into their own communities, ensuring that our voices resonate for those still discovering their capacity to impact change.</p>
                    
                    <p>Collaboration is vital, and forging partnerships aligned with the SDGs will enhance our efforts. Through unity and shared knowledge, we can cultivate enduring change that only addresses climate challenges and transforms our societies for the better. Every choice we make today shapes the future of our planet and impacts generations to come.</p>
                    
                    <p>In embracing this recognition, I am motivated to continue pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve together. This honor signifies not only my individual efforts but also the incredible potential of our collective action. Let us inspire one another to dream bigger and work harder toward a sustainable future where our ripple effects lead to profound and lasting legacies for our environment and communities.</p>
                    
                    <p>We must inspire each other to work harder, reach further and dream bigger as we strive for a sustainable future where the ripple effect of our actions leads to a profound and lasting legacy for our environment and our communities. We must remain steadfast in our commitment to impactful climate action and environmental sustainability, ensuring that we create a better tomorrow for all.</p>
